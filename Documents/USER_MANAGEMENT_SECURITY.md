# 🔐 User Management Security Implementation

## ✅ **What Was Implemented**

### **1. Self-Deletion Prevention** 🛡️
Users **cannot delete their own account** - critical security feature!

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Delete button **disabled** for current user
- ✅ Tooltip shows "You cannot delete your own account"
- ✅ Server-side validation in `DeleteUser()` method
- ✅ Username comparison check

```csharp
private bool IsCurrentUser(User user)
{
    return user.Username.Equals(_currentUsername, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase);
}

// In DeleteUser method
if (IsCurrentUser(userToDelete))
{
    Snackbar.Add("You cannot delete your own account", Severity.Warning);
    return;
}
```

### **2. Permission-Based Access Control** 🔑

#### **Required Permission:** `ManageUsers`

**What's Protected:**
- ✅ **Add User button** - Only visible with permission
- ✅ **Delete User button** - Only visible with permission
- ✅ **Restore User button** - Only visible with permission
- ✅ **Show Deleted toggle** - Only visible with permission
- ✅ **Edit User button** - Visible if has permission OR editing own profile

**Permission Check:**
```csharp
private bool HasPermission(string permissionName)
{
    return _currentUser?.HasClaim("Permission", permissionName) ?? false;
}
```

---

### **3. Granular Permission Checks** 📋

#### **CanEditUser()**
```csharp
private bool CanEditUser(User user)
{
    // Can edit if has permission OR editing own profile
    return HasPermission("ManageUsers") || IsCurrentUser(user);
}
```
**Result:** Users can always edit their own profile, even without ManageUsers permission

#### **CanDeleteUser()**
```csharp
private bool CanDeleteUser(User user)
{
    // Cannot delete yourself, must have permission
    if (IsCurrentUser(user)) return false;
    return HasPermission("ManageUsers");
}
```
**Result:** Cannot delete self, must have permission to delete others

#### **CanRestoreUser()**
```csharp
private bool CanRestoreUser()
{
    return HasPermission("ManageUsers");
}
```
**Result:** Only users with ManageUsers permission can restore deleted users

---

### **4. UI Security Features** 🎨

#### **Conditional Rendering**
```razor
@if (HasPermission("ManageUsers"))
{
    <MudButton>Add User</MudButton>
}
```

#### **Disabled State for Current User**
```razor
@if (IsCurrentUser(context) && !context.IsDeleted)
{
    <MudTooltip Text="You cannot delete your own account">
        <MudIconButton Icon="@Icons.Material.Filled.Delete" 
                       Disabled="true" />
    </MudTooltip>
}
```

---

### **5. Multi-Layer Protection** 🛡️🛡️🛡️

**Layer 1: UI Level**
- Buttons hidden/disabled based on permissions
- Visual feedback (tooltips, disabled state)

**Layer 2: Method Level**
```csharp
private async Task DeleteUser(int id)
{
    // Check 1: User exists
    var userToDelete = await UserService.GetByIdAsync(id);
    if (userToDelete == null) return;
    
    // Check 2: Not deleting self
    if (IsCurrentUser(userToDelete))
    {
        Snackbar.Add("You cannot delete your own account", Severity.Warning);
        return;
    }
    
    // Check 3: Has permission
    if (!HasPermission("ManageUsers"))
    {
        Snackbar.Add("You don't have permission to delete users", Severity.Error);
        return;
    }
    
    // Proceed with deletion
}
```

**Layer 3: Service Level**
- Soft delete (can be restored)
- Audit trail (DeletedBy, DeletedAt)

## 🎯 **Security Matrix**

| Action | No Permission | Has ManageUsers | Is Current User |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| View Users | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Add User | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Edit Other User | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Edit Own Profile | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Delete Other User | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Delete Own Account | ❌ **BLOCKED** | ❌ **BLOCKED** | ❌ **BLOCKED** |
| Restore User | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| View Deleted | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |

---

## 🔍 **How It Works**

### **On Page Load:**
```csharp
protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
{
    // Get current user's claims
    var authState = await AuthStateProvider.GetAuthenticationStateAsync();
    _currentUser = authState.User;
    _currentUsername = _currentUser?.Identity?.Name;
    
    // Load data
    await LoadRoles();
    await LoadUsers();
}
```

### **Permission Check Flow:**
```
User clicks Delete button
    ↓
UI checks: CanDeleteUser(user)
    ↓
Returns false if IsCurrentUser(user) == true
    ↓
Returns false if !HasPermission("ManageUsers")
    ↓
Button disabled/hidden
```

### **Server-Side Validation:**
```
DeleteUser(id) called
    ↓
Fetch user from database
    ↓
Check: Is current user? → Block
    ↓
Check: Has permission? → Block
    ↓
Show confirmation dialog
    ↓
Call UserService.DeleteAsync(id)
```

## 🎓 **Interview Talking Points**

### **"How do you prevent users from deleting themselves?"**

**Answer:**
"I implemented multi-layer protection:

1. **UI Layer** - Delete button is disabled with a tooltip for the current user
2. **Method Layer** - `DeleteUser()` checks `IsCurrentUser()` and blocks with a warning
3. **Visual Feedback** - Grayed out button with explanatory tooltip

This prevents accidental self-deletion and ensures at least one admin always exists in the system."

---

### **"How do you implement permission-based access control?"**

**Answer:**
"I use claims-based authorization:

1. **Claims Storage** - Permissions stored as claims in the authentication state
2. **Permission Check** - `HasPermission()` method checks for 'Permission' claims
3. **Conditional Rendering** - UI elements shown/hidden based on permissions
4. **Granular Control** - Different methods for different actions (CanEdit, CanDelete, CanRestore)

This follows the principle of least privilege - users only see what they can do."

---

### **"What if someone bypasses the UI and calls the API directly?"**

**Answer:**
"The UI security is just the first layer. I also have:

1. **Server-side validation** in the DeleteUser method
2. **Service-level checks** in UserService
3. **Database-level** soft delete (can be audited and restored)
4. **Audit trail** tracks who deleted whom

Even if someone bypasses the UI, they still can't delete their own account or delete without permission."

---

### **"Why allow users to edit their own profile without ManageUsers permission?"**

**Answer:**
"This follows the principle of user autonomy. Users should be able to:
- Update their contact information
- Change their password
- Edit their profile details

But they cannot:
- Change their role (privilege escalation)
- Change their department (without approval)
- Delete their account

This is implemented in `CanEditUser()` which returns true if `IsCurrentUser(user)` even without the ManageUsers permission."

## 🔒 **Security Best Practices Followed**

1. ✅ **Defense in Depth** - Multiple layers of security
2. ✅ **Least Privilege** - Users only see what they can access
3. ✅ **Fail Secure** - Default deny, explicit allow
4. ✅ **Audit Trail** - All deletions tracked
5. ✅ **User Feedback** - Clear error messages
6. ✅ **Soft Delete** - Reversible actions
7. ✅ **Claims-Based Auth** - Standard .NET security model
